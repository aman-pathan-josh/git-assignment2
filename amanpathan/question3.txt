Q 3. Under what conditions will Git consider a file that has been deleted as being renamed, and what criteria does Git use to determine that a new file is a renamed version of the deleted file?

Git considers a file as renamed rather than deleted and newly added if the file's content remains similar.
Git compares the content of the deleted file and new file.
If the similarity index exceeds the threshold value(50%), Git recognizes it as a rename.
this is done even if the file extension is different.
