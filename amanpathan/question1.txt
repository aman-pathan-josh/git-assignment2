Q 1. What happens when a file is deleted in the main branch and updated in a feature branch, and how is this handled during a merge?

When a file is deleted in the main branch and updated in a feature branch and when we try to merge the feature branch in main branch merge conflict arises.
So, git cannot decide whether to keep the file from feature branch or delete the file from main branch.

to resolve the conflict we run following command:

git add <filename>

this command tells git that the conflict has been resolved and the file is to be included in next commit.
then we commit the changes and run merge command again to complete the merge.
